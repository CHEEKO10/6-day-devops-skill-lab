Day 1: Getting Started with AWS and EC2

Summary:

On our first day, we embarked on our cloud journey by diving into Amazon Web Services (AWS). We took the initial steps to set up our environment and gain hands-on experience with the fundamental building block of cloud computing: the EC2 instance.

Key Activities:

AWS Account Creation:
We began by creating our own AWS accounts, granting us access to the vast array of cloud services offered by Amazon.
EC2 Instance Launch:
We launched our first Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance. EC2 provides virtual servers in the cloud, allowing us to run applications and workloads.
Instance Connection:
We established a connection to our newly launched EC2 instance, gaining access to its command-line interface. This allowed us to interact directly with the server's operating system.
Basic Command Execution:
We explored the instance's environment by running some basic Linux commands. This familiarized us with the command-line interface and the fundamental way to interact with the server.
Outcome:

We successfully created our AWS account, launched an EC2 instance, and established a connection. We started to get a feel for the cloud environment and how to interact with a remote server. This was the first step in our journey to learn and master cloud computing.
